<h1>Unfiltered Movie Review, According to David O</h1>
<h2>These are my thoughts on 3 movies I've seen so far in 2024</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Saltburn</h3>
<p>This one was a ride. Grave stuff, tub stuff, party stuff - so many twists and turns that made me cringe.<br/>
Rating: 8.5/10</p>

<h3>Promising Young Woman</h3>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the premise was cool. And I was interested by the plot. But the acting was well below subpar and the movie became somewhat predictable.<br/>
Rating: 5.9/10</p>

<h3>Killers of the Flower Moon</h3>
<p>Leo does it again. Did it really have to be over 3 hours? I'm not sure. But did Leo cook??? 1000%<br/>
Rating: 8.3/10</p>
